# Generating Hex Codes


## Problem Statement

You've been given a code snippet that creates random HexCodes for colors, however there seems to be a bug with the code that sometimes return 5 hex digits instead of 6.

Can you find out the bug and fix it. You can modify the function code to always return a proper hexCode. You have been also given a sample snippet to see the hex Codes generated by the function.

Here is how a sample hex Code looks like

```
#afc3d1
```
- **af** ➔ Represents the **Red (R)** component in the hexadecimal color system.
- **c3** ➔ Represents the **Green (G)** component in the hexadecimal color system.
- **d1** ➔ Represents the **Blue (B)** component in the hexadecimal color system.

> For testing the code you've written the function should be exported, do not change the default export of the function.

**code:**
```js
/**
 * Returns a 6 digit hexCode prepended with '#' as a valid color code
 * @returns {string} hexCode
 */
export function generateRandomHexCode() {
	let hexCode = "#";

	for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		hexCode += Math.floor(Math.random() * 256).toString(16);
	}

	return hexCode;
}

// You can log the results of the function to debug
// Sample Strings
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	console.log(generateRandomHexCode());
}

```

## Challenges

`generateRandomHexCode()` should always return a string of length `7` characters

`generateRandomHexCode()` should always return a valid 6 digit hex code prepended with `#`
